WEBVTT captioned by mohsen

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.159
Greetings. Salaam.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.159
This is Mohsen Banan.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.839
I am a software and internet engineer.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.679
The title of this presentation

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.839
is "Blee-LCNT: An Emacs Centered

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.659
Content Production and Self-Publication Framework".

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.559
Blee stands for

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.279
ByStar Libre-Halaal Emacs Environment.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.799
In last year's EmacsConf,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.079
I introduced Blee, BISOS and ByStar

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.439
as concepts and as foundations.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.079
This year I want to focus

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.879
on one concrete capability.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.959
Content Production and Self-Publication

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.119
is a foundational Blee and BISOS Capability Bundle.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.759
Both this presentation

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.079
and the Nature of Polyexistentials book

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.879
were developed with Blee-LCNT.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.759
In this presentation I want to look at Emacs

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.519
as a central ingredient

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.959
for a usage environment

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.919
that we can use to orchestrate production of

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.079
quite fancy multi-media presentations.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.079
Let's consider two different scopes.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.919
First, the scope of Blee-LCNT Capabilities Bundle,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.919
which is that of a complete

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.599
multi-media content authorship,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.799
generation, publication

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.639
and distribution framework.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.999
That complete scope is presented in this slide

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.239
and it spans both black ink

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.639
and violet ink.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.799
Second, the scope of this presentation,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.119
which is more limited.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.919
In this presentation I confine myself

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.519
to the bullets is violet ink.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.159
Here, I focus on presentation

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.599
and video as content types

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.999
and their authorship and generation

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.319
and their federated re-publication.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.559
This is a common topic.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.839
It makes good sense for us to start with

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.079
a review of prior art and similar art.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.959
I went through the past EmacsConf talks

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.919
and found a good number of them

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.999
that also deal with the topic

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.839
of content generation.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.319
A few of these are included

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.359
in black ink in this slide.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.599
Many of these have chosen the Babel,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.719
in other words Org-Mode+LaTeX as primary input.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.599
I prefer the inverse of that.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.839
I also looked for past talks

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.999
which have used Reveal.js and LaTeX-Beamer.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.399
For example, Sacha's use of Reveal.js

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.959
is shown in violet inK.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.419
And Ihor's use of Beamer is in teal ink.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.399
This presentation is about a combination

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.639
of Reveal.js and LaTeX-Beamer.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.599
For those who may not be familiar

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.619
with Beamer and Reveal,

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.799
here is a quick intro.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.039
Among academics, LaTeX-Beamer is the go-to tool

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.159
for producing presentations.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.239
Reveal.js is recognized

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.919
as the best of breed

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.919
for dispensing HTML slide decks.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.439
For many, Reveal and Beamer

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.959
live in different universes.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.679
Beamer is pdf oriented

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.019
and Reveal is html oriented.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.519
Combining two powerful tools

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.359
makes for an even more powerful tool.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.879
This Blee-LCNT Presentations combines

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.159
the best of LaTeX-Beamer with Reveal.js.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.679
Beamer primarily functions as producer

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.099
and Reveal functions as dispenser

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.579
and multi-media enhancer.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.299
Here is how the combination works.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.439
LaTeX Beamer pdf result

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.839
is disected into named frame images

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.799
which can then be inserted in Reveal.js.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.239
LaTeX Beamer frames can also be

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.799
translated into html with HeVeA

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.999
which can also be inserted in Reveal.js.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.119
Voice-overs for Beamer frames

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.039
can be correlated to frame names

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.119
and applied to image or html frames.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.079
Screen captures and image narrations as videos

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.359
can be directly dispensed

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.379
through Reveal.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.439
There are various additional novel concepts

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.599
with regard to the way

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.559
that we have integrated all of this together.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.599
Instead of Org-Mode+LaTeX,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.999
we do LaTeX+Org-Mode.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.999
Instead of Babel, we do COMEEGA,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.999
instead of the Literate model

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.839
we introduce the Surrounded model.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.839
You shall see various examples

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.519
of these shortly.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.639
All of this is part of a bigger picture.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.619
A much bigger picture.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.599
My talks at EmacsConf 2021, 2022

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.519
and 2024 are related.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.399
This 2025 talk builds on those.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.719
Last year's talk "About Blee:

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.839
enveloping our own autonomy

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.999
directed digital ecosystem

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.199
with Emacs" in particular,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.979
lays the foundations for this talk.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.119
If you have not seen that,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.159
it would make good sense to review it.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.279
In my previous talks I have been criticized

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.359
of having a "prophetic" style.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.059
The scope of ByStar is lofty and immense.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.879
In many ways it is unbelievable.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.139
And EmacsConf talks are meant to be short.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.839
So, as a result, sometimes

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.959
I end up being cryptic.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.499
Having accepted the "prophetic" criticism

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.399
as legitimate,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.599
I now need to put a book on the table.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.839
With that book in place, moving forward,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.339
when needing to be cryptic,

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.559
I shall cite Chapter and Verse.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.879
I am delighted to announce

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.559
the availability of my recent book,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.199
"Nature of Polyexistentials".

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.959
The full title of my book is:

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.039
Nature Of Polyexistentials---

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.239
Basis For Abolishment Of The Western

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.219
Intellectual Property Rights Regime---

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.899
And Introduction Of The Libre-Halaal

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.999
ByStar Digital Ecosystem.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.199
Knowledge, know-how, uses of know-how,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.879
ideas, formulas, software and information

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.519
are inherently non-scarce.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.439
They are *polyexistentials*.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.239
Unlike monoexistentials

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.259
which exist in singular,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.539
polyexistentials naturally exist in multiples.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.559
What is abundant in nature

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.599
is being made artificially scarce

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.399
through man-made ownership rules

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.599
called copyright and patents.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.239
These mistaken ownership rules,

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.959
the so called Western IPR regime,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.319
has immense ramifications

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.839
on the shape and the direction

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.619
of the American Digital Ecosystem.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.119
It would be an understatement to say

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.779
that the American Digital Ecosystem

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.599
has put humanity in danger.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.099
Two parts of the book, in particular

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.679
are of immediate relevance.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.219
Part III, the ethics layer,

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.119
focuses on contours of cures.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.839
Having dismissed the Western

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.119
intellectual property rights (IPR) regime

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.739
as an erroneous governance model for polyexistentials,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.319
I propose the Libre-Halaal model

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.199
of governance of polyexistentials

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.779
towards facilitating conviviality of tools.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.359
Part IV, the engineering layer,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.599
introduces the Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.399
as an ethical alternative

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.239
to the prevailing proprietary

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.499
American digital ecosystem.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.479
The book also provides additional details

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.919
about the content generation

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.919
and publication facilities

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.839
that I am presenting here.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.079
And the book itself, as content,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.439
was generated and published

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.319
using the facilities

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.239
that I am presenting here.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.199
You can think of this book

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.159
as being in two volumes.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.919
Our focus are Blee and BISOS in Volume II.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.239
Volume I deals with the general concept

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.879
of polyexistence and invalidity

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.679
of IPR and our terminoloy of Libre-Halaal---

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.519
instead of the common but ill directed vocabulary

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.239
of Free Software and Open-Source and FOSS.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.239
In Chapter 11, I introduce

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.759
the very sensitive and potent vocabulary

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.719
of Halaal and Libre-Halaal.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.079
The contents of this book

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.659
belong to all of humanity

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.519
and verbatim copying of it is unrestricted.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.479
If you want to read it, this book is yours.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.839
The "Nature of Polyexistentials" book

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.659
is available both online and in print.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.439
This book is available as two editions.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.819
The US Edition and the International edition.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.959
The US Edition is written

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.079
with a slightly milder Western unfriendly tone,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.399
while the International Edition

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.619
includes additional original content in Farsi.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.399
I consider the International Edition

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.979
to be the authoritative version.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.319
However, many readers in

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.319
the US and Western countries

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.199
may prefer the US Edition.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.999
I maintain separate Git repositories

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.039
for each edition on GitHub:

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:42.839
US Edition is at bxplpc/120033

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:51.419
and International Edition: bxplpc/120074

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.679
Cloning these repositories

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.399
will give you access to the book

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.039
in PDF format (suitable for both

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.039
A4 and US Letter printing)

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.379
and in EPUB format.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.559
Alternatively, the content

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.039
can be downloaded directly from your browser

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:17.259
without needing to clone the repositories.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.079
To ensure broader online

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.899
availability and stability,

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.159
I have also published the book on Zenodo,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.779
complete with a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.439
You can download both the A4

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.639
and 8.5 x 11 PDFs from there as well.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.119
The book is also available in print on Amazon

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.239
and at most major bookstores

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.379
in the US and Western regions.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.519
The ISBNs for both editions

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.139
are included in this slide.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.319
Additionally, I have published

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.719
this book in Iran through Jangal Publishers.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.079
I did not write this book for profit.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.359
My aim is to share my thoughts

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.599
and encourage readers to engage with my views and ideas.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.499
Your feedback is welcome,

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.119
and I am genuinely interested

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.199
in hearing your perspectives.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.879
In Western markets, I have priced the print edition

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.339
somewhat above production costs.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.639
If you find value in the book

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.599
and the ByStar project,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.759
purchasing a copy will help support my work.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.459
Thanks in advance for your support.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.479
And here are the same links

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.179
as a native Reveal slide.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.839
If instead of a video,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.759
you are viewing this presentation as a Reveal web page,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.639
you can just click on the pointers and URLs.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.079
Instead of the traditional model

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.559
of giving you recipes in a DIY context

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.479
towards the goal of creating

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.559
content processing capabilities

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.659
on top of what you may already have,

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.959
I am doing the opposite.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:15.159
I am saying: take this whole BISOS and Blee thing,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.559
and in there you will also have

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.239
the content processing capabil ities

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.579
that I am speaking of here.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.919
So, at the top level we have

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.519
our own autonomy and privacy

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.199
directed digital ecosystem,

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.839
which in contrast to the center oriented

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.659
American digital ecosystem,

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.479
is edge oriented.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.919
We call it: "The Libre-Halaal

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.919
ByStar Digital Ecosystem".

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.799
All the systems in ByStar,

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.699
run BISOS (By* Internet Services OS),

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.759
which is a layer on top of Debian.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.199
The usage environment of ByStar and BISOS is Blee

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.579
which is a layer on top of Emacs.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.919
With those in place, we then create

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:10.139
a capability bundle called Blee-LCNT.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.039
So, when you buy into Blee and BISOS,

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.199
you will naturally also get

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.719
these content processing capabilities---

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.119
without a need for any recipies or DIY effort.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.879
If you were to look at the model

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.119
that I introduced as containment hierarchies,

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.279
it would look like this.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.779
We love Emacs and we love Unix

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.759
because their design is convivial.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.199
By convivial, I am referring

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.759
to Ivan Illich's concept

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.319
and terminology of "Tools for Conviviality".

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.679
It was first published in 1973.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.959
It's a must read.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.639
A goal of the design

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.799
of the ByStar Digital Ecosystem

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.479
is to enlarge the aggregated

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.719
conviviality of its capabilities.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.719
What distinguishes Blee-LCNT

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.959
from other content processing tools and frameworks,

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.439
is our emphasis on enhancing

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.659
the aggregated conviviality.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.259
These tools let you express yourself.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.999
They let you be in charge.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.499
Here is our parts list.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.839
These are the components

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.959
that we have chosen to bring together

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.779
towards our goal of creating convivial tools.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.039
In this slide we are using black ink

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.519
to denote exisiting tools

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.339
and we use violet ink

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.419
to denote pieces that we have developed

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.100
towards cohesive integration.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.867
[This] video,

00:15:47.868 --> 00:15:51.479
the video is just one of the outputs.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.499
There are other outputs as well.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.359
In this figure, the outputs

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.859
are shown in the top layer.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.279
Using this video as an example,

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.599
this presentation's output also include

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.599
the "Presentation Form"

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.999
and the "Article-Presentation Form".

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.719
Let's look at these more closely.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.259
For Presentations, there are 3 different forms.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.559
The Video Form, the Presentation From

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.819
and the Article-Presentation Form.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:27.439
The Presentation Form produces both a pdf output

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.079
and Reveal output.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.879
Next we will walkthrough some of the benefits

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.519
that availability of these forms

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.099
and formats provide.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.959
The video presentation that you are watching

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.599
is just one of the outputs

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.479
of the Blee-LCNT machinery.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.679
There are two PDF format outputs

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.439
and two HTML outputs

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.859
that are also quite useful.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.119
The primary output of Beamer

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.239
is a set of slides

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:10.439
that people use to give their talks with.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.479
Typically that's done live.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:19.179
In my case I dissect the images of each frame

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.639
and do a voiceover on it

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:28.839
and then dispense it through reveal.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.379
In a second you will see that as well.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.959
This PDF output is very useful.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.279
You get the table of contents of course

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.279
and in addition to that Beam er

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.319
generates navigations for you

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.599
where on any part you get

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.839
a small table of content as well.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.119
This is heavily used amongst academics

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.959
and it's a good output on its own

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.319
and I'm augmenting it

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.399
in a variety of ways.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.719
In addition to the presentation PDF format

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:15.359
there is also an article-presentation PDF format

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.799
which gives you the same content

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:25.159
but it gives it to you in a textual form

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.939
with the table of content and the rest.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.759
This is a good form to use

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.919
when you are giving for example class lectures

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.719
and the students often prefer this format.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.079
Now for the HTML format

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.839
outputs the most relevant

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.599
of course is the reveal itself.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:05.679
If you have not used reveal before.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.559
In my view it's a HTML slide dispenser.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.479
I don't look at it as a presentation framework.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:22.599
I use, as you are seeing, we use Beamer to feed into it

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.759
and we use it to dispense the information.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:33.439
It has all the typical navigation

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:39.959
capabilities that you would expect

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.319
and most of what I have as slides are images

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.239
but occasionally particularly when there is a need

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.999
to provide pointers, HTML pointers.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:01.439
I then also include a textual output.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.559
This is also produced

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.839
from the Beamer latex source

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.959
but it's HTML through textual HTML

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.019
through HeVeA not the image.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.499
You can... you get a table of contents.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:28.079
You can navigate and there are a whole lot of other features

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.979
that reveal also provides.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.879
So to generate the video,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.980
what I do is I come to

00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:49.459
the very beginning of the presentation.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.519
I turn on the screen capture recorder

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.159
and then I start playing

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.239
the voiceover for each slide

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.519
and at the very end you get a video

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:08.759
but what you just did is you dispensed every frame

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.279
one at a time through reveal.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.319
In addition to this HTML form

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:22.239
you also get a article presentation form of it

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.159
with a full table of content

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.759
and the videos are there and the notes are there

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:33.479
and this is also quite useful.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.519
Now, let's look at the one single input file

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.879
that produced all of the outputs

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.879
that we just saw.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.079
I have put both the input file

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.119
and some of the output files

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.299
for this presentation on github.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.839
Here are some links

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.679
to these repos and files.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.679
And here are the same links

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.119
as a native Reveal slide.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.879
This figure gives us an overview

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.759
of how one set of inputs

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.959
encapsulted in a single file

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.759
can produce all of the outputs that we saw.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.439
The main TeX file shown at the bottom

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.659
is processed by both XeLaTeX and by HeVeA.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.279
That main TeX file, in addition

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.679
to LaTeX syntax

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.999
also include org-mode constructs

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.039
that facilitate addition of audio and video files.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:34.879
Later, I'll walkthrough the bodyPresArtEnFa.tex file

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.179
that generated this very presentation with you.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.679
When you construct that primary TeX file,

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.679
there are several abstractions

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.899
that you need to keep in mind.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.119
Is my presentation going to go

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.739
from Left-To-Right or from Right-To-Left?

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.039
Perso-Arabic presentations go from Right-To-Left.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.679
Another consideration is the types

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.119
of forms of results that you want.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.019
Just the presentation

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.999
or Article-Presentation as well?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.879
With those choices in place

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.399
you can produce condition based text

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.199
for each of your desired outputs.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.919
Think of this video presentation

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.879
as a sequence of frames.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:26.119
Each frame is controlled by an org-mode dynamic block.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.039
This table lists available dblocks

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.559
from which you can choose.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.039
For example, this particular frame

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:34.839
that we are watching

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:41.979
is controlled by b:lcnt:pres:frame/derivedImage.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.639
Beamer creates a pdf file

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.879
that includes the image of this slide.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.459
That image is then injected into Reveal.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:55.359
And in the end a video of that image is produced

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.239
with the narrations

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.259
that I am uttering right now.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.199
All of this has similarly been applied

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.599
to each and every frame

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.919
that you have been watching.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.399
Similar to Frame Controls,

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.719
there are org-mode dynamic blocks

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.519
for "Frame Body Types".

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.839
You can easily insert an image

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.639
which is typically created by OpenOffice Draw

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.619
into a frame.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.359
Same with say a screen capture video.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.319
Now that we have looked at the "Outputs" and the "Inputs",

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.679
let's look at how the Outputs

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.919
are generated from the Inputs.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.399
Let's bootstrap Raw-BISOS and Raw-Blee.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.719
Starting from scratch,

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.799
get yourself a fresh copy of Debian 12.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:52.719
Then go to https://github.com/bxGenesis/ start

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.079
The README.org file

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.119
of that github repo

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.639
is same as Chapter 18,

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.959
"Engineering Adoption of BISOS and ByStar" of the book.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.359
We will next run "raw-bisos.sh",

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.959
but prior to that let's take a quick look.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.759
This bootstrap scripts will do a lot as root

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.479
on your Fresh-Debian.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.599
It is best to first try it

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.179
on a disposable VM.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:27.159
raw-bisos.sh adds the current debian user to sudoers.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.399
Then it installs pipx.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.199
And then with pipx it installs

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.999
from PyPI bisos.provision.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.279
bisos.provision includes additional bash scripts

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.359
that are then executed.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.159
Full installation involves

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.039
setting up various accounts, groups,

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.279
various directory hierarchies,

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.439
lots of apt packages

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.979
and lots of python packages

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.499
from the bisos namespace.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.879
If you are ready, copy and paste

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.599
this line and run it.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.039
You will be prompted

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.619
for the root password.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.279
Then be patient.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.559
Full installation

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.519
can take 15 minutes or so.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.079
The logs of this script

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.519
are also captured

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:25.199
in ~/raw-bisos-${dateTag}-log.org

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.959
Now that we have Raw-BISOS and Raw-Blee installed,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.039
we are ready to walk through

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.319
the unified source

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.439
of the very presentation

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.259
that you are watching.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:40.959
The "bodyPresArtEnFa.tex" file

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.439
that we will visit

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.059
is in COMEEGA-LaTeX syntax

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.699
with lots of org-mode dblocks

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.479
which generate Beamer-LaTeX frames

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.139
and conditioned LaTeX bodies.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.599
After the walkthrough,

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.359
I'll describe dblocks and COMEEGA in more detail.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.239
At the tail end of the walkthrough,

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.319
we will also go through the generation process

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:10.859
which runs XeLaTeX and HeVeA and a lot more.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.619
Let's look at our input file.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:17.019
It's a LaTeX file in LaTeX mode

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:24.279
and it has org syntax org-mode included in it

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:29.559
and I can toggle between LaTeX and org-mode

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.599
so, now I'm gonna be in org-mode

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.839
and org-mode gives me everything

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.399
that org has to offer

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:46.479
including a very convenient navigation framework.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:54.279
So let's take one slide and take a look at how it was done.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:58.679
So I would come to this scope slide

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:03.999
and while I am there I'm gonna click on N.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.759
N takes me to the native LaTeX form back

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:16.359
so that I'll be looking at it not in org but in LaTeX.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:24.199
So we're back in LaTeX and as you can see it

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.999
uses a dynamic block

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.799
starting with the comments and the BEGIN

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.839
and it uses a dynamic block

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:38.079
named a framedDrive image

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:45.399
which means the content of this frame

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:50.439
will be dispensed as an image not as text

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:56.899
and it also automatically creates for me

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.439
a name, a label, that can be used

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:05.119
for voiceover augmentation.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.119
So a file in the audio directory

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:13.039
called ScopeOfBleeLcnt.mp3

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:19.319
is this audio that will come on top of this slide

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:24.079
and then the rest is the LaTeX itself.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:29.679
The concept of "Org Dynamic Blocks"

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.519
is very powerful.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.599
I think of them as universal

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.179
visible macros.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:41.359
But, why should they be primarily used in just Org-Mode.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.639
I say let's generalize them

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.059
to "Emacs Dynamic Blocks".

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.959
Have defaults for org-dblock-start-re

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.159
in every relevant mode

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.099
and use them everywhere.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.319
Blee does that.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:01.719
In COMEEGA-LaTeX, Dynamic Blocks create Frame Controls

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.519
and insert Image and Video contents.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.519
Much of Blee and BISOS

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.959
are implemented in COMEEGA.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.599
Almost all of our Elisp, Python, Bash

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.199
and LaTeX work uses COMEEGA.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.299
COMEEGA stands for Collaborative

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.679
Org-Mode

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.759
Enhanced Emacs Generalized Authorship.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.879
It is the inverse of org-babel.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.999
COMEEGA adds org-mode

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.099
to your programming mode.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.079
Full and proper use of COMEEGA,

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.299
requires Polymode.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.359
Let's call that Poly-COMEEGA.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.319
But Emacs's Polymode

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.679
is work-in-progress,

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.199
particularly now with the new tree-sitter.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.199
So, in the interim, my usage of COMEEGA

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.919
has been in the form of Toggle-COMEEGA.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.479
Where I manually switch between

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.359
the programming-mode and org-mode.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.199
For me this has proved to be

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.799
a fine interim solution.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.679
Naturally, content processing

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.239
should be multi-lingual

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.159
and internationalized.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.839
Let's look at that dimension.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:21.019
I am Iranian and much of what I write is in Farsi.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.519
Getting Perso-Arabic text right

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.519
is often a challenge,

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:30.059
as it involves Bi-Directional text (BIDI)

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.999
and shaping of characters.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.039
In the context of our content generation

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.819
these need to span all relevant tools,

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.759
not just emacs.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.759
For emacs, I have created

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.239
my own input method

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.419
called farsi-transliterate-banan.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:54.139
My EmacsConf 2021 talk was about that.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.199
Now let's look at some examples

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.699
and spice it up a bit with semantics.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.279
As and example of proper BIDI text,

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.899
here is the orignal Farsi text

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.359
along with English translation

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.519
of Imam Khomeini's text

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.479
with respect to invalidity

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:20.399
of Western Intellectual Proprty Rights regime.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.039
And as another example

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.479
of proper BIDI text,

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.919
here is Ayatollah Mothari's take on Western IPR

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:35.159
not being private property. Note that these predate

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.919
by more than half a century

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:43.239
Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk's tweets of April 11, 2025

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:47.199
saying "Delete all IP law".

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.159
This topic is too important

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.399
and too sensitive

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.639
to be left to American Billionaires

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.639
and their tweets.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.199
Let me again refer you to the logic

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.599
of polyexistentials in my book.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:06.359
Chapter 14 of the book is dedicated to

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.579
Ethics and ownership in Religions.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.919
With respect to my preference

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.719
for Ethics over Freedom,

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.519
let me refer you to Section 12. 4

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.079
"A Cynical Perspective

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.859
on Freedom Orientation of Americans"

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.999
in which I describe where the FOSS labels

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.039
and the likes of Stallman, Raymond,

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.599
Moglen and Lessig have gone wrong.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.239
If you are one of their followers,

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.599
perhaps Chapter 12 is for you.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:42.279
My emphasis thus far has been on content generation.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.999
Let's very briefly also look at

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.159
Autonomous Self-Publication

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:52.279
and Federated Re-Publications of our content.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.759
From the very beginning the Debian folks

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.039
understood the importance of "Universality"

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.359
and coined the "Universal Debian" label.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.919
This means that we can base

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.619
our entire digital ecosystem

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:13.499
on just the Libre-Halaal Debian distro.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:17.299
And that is what we have done with ByStar.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.039
In ByStar everything is based on

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:24.119
just the Universal Debian everywhere.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.999
This has made our Usage Environment

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.319
totally harmonious with our Service Environment

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:38.059
allowing for very powerful software-service continuums.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.479
Of course, all of this is immediatly applicable

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:46.019
to our ByStar Content Bundle as well.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:50.519
Some have asked, why don't you also include Ubuntu?

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.679
I think the opposite makes more sense.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.699
Ubuntu should converge with Debian.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.639
I tried to explain this to Mark Shuttleworth

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.479
in an email a while back.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.119
I have included that email

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.719
in Section 12.1.5.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.439
In this presentation, we have stopped

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.159
at the "Raw-BISOS" stage.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.759
We can further evolve Raw-BISOS

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.959
and make it be "Sited"

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.239
and provide autonomous publication services.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.679
But here by going through EmacsConf and youtube

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.959
we are using the "Federated Re-Publications" model.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.479
Something this large,

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.479
should be well documented.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.079
In Emacs, the way that

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.319
we have been dealing with documentation

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.439
and information retrieval is archaic.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.079
Man-pages, TeXInfo, Helpful-Mode

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:51.599
and convention based Doc-Strings are old and limited.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.279
In BISOS and Blee, we use Blee-Panels

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.739
for all kinds of documentation.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:02.559
Let me show you some examples.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.199
So, what next?

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:10.599
If Blee, BISOS, ByStar, Libre-Halaal, Polyexistentials

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.159
and these Content Processing capabilities

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.639
have piqued your interest,

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.379
please feel welcome to contact me.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.239
These Emacs Conferences have proven

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.379
to be very useful and productive.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.199
I look forward to your thoughts,

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.599
feedback and questions.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:35.359
I want to thank all the EmacsConf 2025 Organizers

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.199
for their great work,

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.640
and Sacha in particular.
